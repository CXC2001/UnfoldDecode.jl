## Summary of our work

#### Getting familiar with EEG data and Unfold
First, we familiarized ourselves with a simple example and thus enhanced our basic understanding of EEG data and plotting and Unfold.

#### Reading related papers
Secondly, we read and fully understood the concepts and ideas of BacktoBack regression from related papers, which helped us through the coding and documentationing for the b2b solver. 

#### Building vivid example for easy understanding
Thirdly, we built an vivid example of a model of dogs, cats, vegetables etc. to help the users understand the basic ideas of what BacktoBack does, that is, to eliminate the effect of correlated (confounding) variable. And we successfully applied the BacktoBack regression on it.

#### Adding serval regression functions to b2b_solver
Forthly, we added several new regression functions(LS, Lasso, SVM, Adaboost) and revised the ridge function in the b2b solver algorithms.

#### Comparing the results
Lastly, we compared the results of different functions. And SVM would be the most ideal one.
